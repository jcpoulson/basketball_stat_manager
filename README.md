# basketball_stat_manager
This project is a stat manager for a three different basketball teams, although it doesn't actually edit stats from a users view point, this program uses Python to work with a large data file. This Python program cleans the data and also completes tasks like assigning players to teams and balancing them equally based on experience.

From a user perspective all this program does is allow the user to view team statistics but deep inside the code, this script works with the data a tremendous amount.
